If you look at the map of Africa, you will find a continent surrounded by the great blue water of the Great Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and Arabian See. Majority of the countries hosts tremendous beaches, except from Mali, Chand, Niger, and Chand full of adventures and tourist attraction.

In our today’s blog, we have crafted a handpicked list of 10 Most Stunning [African Beaches](https://www.sassabi.com/extensions/tanzania-zanzibar-holiday/).

Stay tuned till the last, to know everything you need to know before you plan your after beach tour in 2025.

1. ### Mtende beach- Zanzibar Island, Tanzania

Mtende Beach should be added to your African Travel itinerary if you consider yourself a beach person and intend to visit Zanzibar. In this blog post, I’ve covered everything you should know before visiting Mtende Beach so that you can have the best experience possible. The central portion of the beach is located in a large cove between two rock formations. One of the most stunning spots on the island to watch the tides change is breathtaking.

If you didn’t already know, Zanzibar has some of the most extreme tides I have ever seen. In that respect, Mtende Beach is similar to the majority of other beaches. Whenever you plan to visit Mtende, do your homework and find out when the tides will be out and in. You can walk the entire length of the beach when the tide is low, but when the tide is high, it extends to the stairs.

Mtende Beach is surrounded by Government-protected land that is largely undeveloped. This is why the area charges an entrance fee. The only hotel in the vicinity is also an [eco-hotel in Zanzibar](https://www.sassabi.com/camps-lodges-2/). It’s essential to note that few phone carriers offer service in the area; however, one restaurant provides Wi-Fi if needed. It’s best to agree on a pickup time with your driver before you part ways because it can be challenging to communicate with them once they arrive. None of the carriers we tried had service in the area, despite our efforts. The beach truly is the ideal location to disconnect from the outside world as a result!

2. ### Anse Lazio- Praslin Island, Seychelles

For many people, the first time they see Anse Lazio, the moment takes their breath away. The perfect combination of sun, sea, and sand makes it an incredible beach by anyone’s definition. There is a designated swimming area surrounded by a net that keeps fish and other aquatic creatures from disturbing swimmers. A lifeguard is often on duty, ensuring visitors can feel safe while in the water. The beach is also excellent for snorkelling, with great visibility in the crystal-clear water, and is equally well-suited to families thanks to the large, sandy areas where children can play. However, the water does get deep quickly, so children and unconfident swimmers should stay in the designated area and try not to stray too far from the shore.

3. ### Anse Source D'Argent- La Digue Island, Seychelles

One of the main reasons for the Anse Source D'Argent beach’s popularity, besides its astounding beauty, is the variety of activities it offers. The shallow, clear water, as well as the protection of the coral reef, make the beach a great spot for families and are also perfect for swimming and snorkelling. That said, it can be challenging to swim here at low tide, as the water is extremely shallow. However, at high tide, the water is deep enough to swim while still being shallow enough to be safe for most swimmers.

4. ### Anse Georgette- Praslin Island, Seychelles

Anse Georgette is one of the few truly untouched beaches in the Seychelles, offering natural, astounding beauty. With so many positives, it’s easy to see why the beach is so popular, and guests come from all over the island to enjoy this incredible spot, making it an absolute must-see for any Seychelles holidaymaker.

5. ### Le Morne Beach- Mauritius, Africa

Le Morne Beach in Mauritius is renowned for its dramatic backdrop of the impressive Le Morne Brabant mountain, a UNESCO World Heritage site. This iconic peak enhances the views from the beach and water, adding to the overall experience for visitors. The area is known for its strong winds and waves, making it a favorite among kite surfers and windsurfers worldwide. Despite these active waters, parts of the beach offer calm, clear areas ideal for swimming and snorkeling, protected by coral reefs that encircle the bay. Le Morne also holds historical significance as the mountain once served as a refuge for runaway slaves, adding profound cultural importance to its natural beauty.

6. ### Camp's Bay Beach-Camps Bay, South Africa

Just up Kloof Nek Road from the center of town is this thriving beach community. Plenty of trendy nightclubs, shops, and cafes bring diners and shoppers, while tranquil seas and fine white sand draw sun worshippers and swimmers.

7. ### Pereybere Beach-Mauritius, Africa

Pereybere Beach in Mauritius boasts soft, white sand and crystal-clear blue water, with a designated swimming area that’s perfect for both paddling and swimming. Like other beaches in the area, it’s protected by a reef located slightly further out, which helps keep the water calm and at a pleasant depth. While some beaches in Mauritius can be rocky, making water shoes a wise choice, the sand at Pereybere was soft enough that I didn’t find them necessary. That said, stonefish can sometimes be found in parts of Mauritius, so you might prefer to wear them just to be safe. I visited in May, and although the water had a lovely blue hue, it wasn’t particularly clear, making it unsatisfactory for swimming, but not ideal for snorkeling. A local I spoke with at La Cuvette Beach mentioned that the water is much clearer during the summer months.

8. ### Plage de l'Ermitage-Saint-Gilles-Les-Bains, Reunion Island

Plage de l'Ermitage, also known as Hermitage Beach, is a stunning stretch of white sand located on the west coast of Réunion Island, between Saint-Gilles-les-Bains and La Saline. Spanning approximately 7 kilometers, this beach is renowned for its calm, shallow lagoon protected by a natural coral reef, making it an ideal spot for safe swimming and snorkeling. The lagoon is part of the Réserve Naturelle Marine de La Réunion, home to a diverse array of marine life, including vibrant corals and tropical fish. The beach is shaded by filaos trees, providing a perfect setting for picnics and relaxation. Visitors can enjoy local Creole cuisine from nearby beachside restaurants, known as rondavelles, and indulge in tropical-flavored ice creams from roaming vendors. Plage de l'Ermitage is a favorite among families and tourists alike, offering a picturesque and tranquil beach experience.

9. ### Belle Mare Beach - Mauritius, Africa

Belle Mare Beach, situated on the east coast of Mauritius, is renowned for its pristine white sands, crystal-clear turquoise waters, and tranquil atmosphere. Stretching approximately 10 kilometers from Belle Mare village to Trou d’Eau Douce, this beach is lined with casuarina trees that provide natural shade, making it an ideal spot for relaxation and strolls. The calm lagoon is ideal for swimming, snorkeling, and various water sports, providing visitors with the opportunity to explore the vibrant marine life in a serene setting. Despite its popularity, Belle Mare Beach maintains a peaceful ambiance, especially on weekdays, as it tends to attract more locals during weekends. The area is also home to several luxury resorts and hotels, providing a range of accommodations for travelers seeking both comfort and proximity to the beach. Whether you're looking to unwind under the sun, engage in water activities, or simply enjoy the natural beauty, Belle Mare Beach offers a quintessential Mauritian beach experience.

10. ### Tarrafal Beach- Santiago, Cape Verde

It is worth taking a stroll through Tarrafal’s historical quarter to discover its main square, its church, its gardens, and its cobblestone streets, whose architecture testifies to its Portuguese colonial past. The concentration camp, known as the ‘Portuguese Auschwitz’, situated in Chao Born, is today a Resistance Museum that makes for an exciting visit. Climbing up to Mount Graciosa to enjoy the best views of the surrounding area is also recommended. Be sure to also visit the Centre of Arts and Crafts in Trás-os-Montes to discover the secrets of traditional pottery. Finally, don’t miss a visit to Mangui beach, a long, beautiful stretch of sand dotted with palm trees. Visiting the municipal market, where the local fishermen's catches arrive, is also highly recommended.

### Final Thoughts

Africa, the magical continent that hosts untouched savannas, adventurous national parks, and diverse cultures, is also ready to colour the minds of the sea-lovers with the vast blue of the romantic beaches in Eastern and Western Africa.

The best part is that the majority of the beaches are very lightly crowded all year long, which enables the tourists to feel the tranquility of the sea at its best.
